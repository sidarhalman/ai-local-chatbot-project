# AI Local Chatbot Project — What We Did (Production‑oriented Summary)

This document summarizes the end‑to‑end plan and the steps we completed or aligned on, without code. You can paste this into your README as a project log and setup guide.

## 1) Architecture & Goals

- Goal: Build a local AI server you control (on Lenovo/Ubuntu) and access it securely from public clients through a managed backend.
- Final topology:
  - Local AI inference runs on Lenovo (Ubuntu) with Ollama and a lightweight LLaMA‑based chat model.
  - A public backend API (Node.js/Express) is deployed on Render to receive requests from web/mobile clients.
  - Cloudflare Tunnel exposes Lenovo’s local Ollama endpoint securely over HTTPS, without opening router ports or exposing a public IP.
  - Render backend talks to Lenovo via the Cloudflare hostname; Lenovo itself remains closed to the public internet.

---

## 2) Technology Choices

- Local inference: **Ollama** on **Ubuntu 22.04 LTS** (Lenovo X250).
- Model: **Llama 2 (7B) chat, q2_K quantization** for low memory footprint and CPU‑only operation suitable for 8 GB RAM.
- Backend: **Node.js + Express** deployed on **Render** as a Web Service.
- Secure exposure: **Cloudflare Tunnel** for a permanent, TLS‑secured hostname that forwards to Lenovo’s localhost service.
- Repository strategy: **Monorepo** (backend and frontend in one GitHub repository) for simpler development and deployment flows.

---

## 3) Lenovo (Ubuntu) — System & Ollama

- Installed and updated Ubuntu packages and essentials.
- Installed Ollama as the local model server.
- Configured Ollama to **bind only to localhost** for security (no direct LAN/WAN exposure).
- Pulled a **lightweight chat model** (Llama 2 7B q2_K) suitable for CPU and limited RAM.
- Verified the local model server responds locally.

---

## 4) Cloudflare Tunnel — Production Setup

- Installed `cloudflared` on Lenovo.
- Authenticated with a Cloudflare account and created a named tunnel.
- Created a tunnel configuration that:
  - Uses a **permanent hostname** (under your domain managed on Cloudflare).
  - Proxies incoming HTTPS requests to **Lenovo’s localhost Ollama port**.
- Mapped DNS in Cloudflare to the tunnel (no router port forwarding required).
- Installed and enabled the tunnel as a **system service** so it survives reboots.
- Verified that the **public hostname** serves the local model endpoint over HTTPS.

---

## 5) Backend (Render) — Service & Environment

- Prepared a minimal Express API to act as the **only public entry point** for web/mobile clients.
- Deployed the backend to **Render** as a Web Service.
- Set environment variables on Render, including:
  - The **Cloudflare Tunnel hostname** for Ollama (used by the backend).
  - A **backend API key** for simple client authentication.
  - Reasonable request timeouts and any other operational parameters.
- Confirmed the backend health check works and can reach the tunnel.

---

## 6) Repository & Project Structure

- Created a GitHub repository (monorepo), e.g.:
  - `backend/` for the Express API.
  - `frontend/` for your web or mobile client (optional at this stage).
- Added a `.gitignore` to avoid committing sensitive files (like `.env`) and node modules.
- Documented environment variables and deployment commands in the README.

---

## 7) End‑to‑End Test Flow

- Confirmed the local model runs and responds on Lenovo.
- Ensured the Cloudflare Tunnel hostname responds over HTTPS with model information.
- Called the **Render backend** endpoint from Postman (or a client app), passing:
  - A prompt payload.
  - The configured API key in headers.
- Observed the full path:
  - Client → Render backend → Cloudflare Tunnel → Lenovo/Ollama → back to Render → Client response.

---

## 8) Security & Operations

- **Ollama bound to localhost** only; no direct public or LAN access.
- **Cloudflare Tunnel** provides TLS, a stable hostname, and avoids router/NAT exposure.
- Public access is limited to the **Render backend** route; the backend enforces an **API key**.
- Suggested enhancements:
  - CORS origin allowlist for your frontend domains.
  - Basic rate limiting on the backend.
  - Structured logging on Render; journaling for `cloudflared` and Ollama on Lenovo.
  - Regular OS/package updates on Lenovo; monitoring CPU/RAM usage during inference.
  - Clear operational runbook for restarting services and rotating keys.

---

## 9) Next Steps

- Complete Cloudflare account/domain setup if not done.
- Finalize the permanent hostname for the tunnel and update the backend’s environment variables.
- Build the frontend/mobile app and point it to the Render backend.
- Iterate on model choice based on quality/performance goals; consider upgrading hardware or moving to a GPU server later if needed.
- Add tests, error handling, and observability as the project matures.

---

## 10) Why This Is “Production‑Oriented”

- No direct exposure of the home network or Ollama service.
- Managed **public surface** via Render only; scalable and observable.
- **Dedicated secure tunnel** with a permanent domain and TLS.
- Clear separation of concerns:
  - Lenovo: inference only.
  - Cloudflare: secure ingress.
  - Render: API, auth, and request handling.
  - Client: UX and business logic.
